"""Tenant lifecycle endpoints for MDR self-serve (issues #883, #884).

- POST /tenants/provision     (#883 PR 4a):       creates a new tenant schema for a
  Cognito group. Called by the post-confirmation Lambda; service-key auth.
- GET  /tenants/mine          (#884 Phase 3 PR 1): lists workspaces accessible
  to the calling user. User-auth only.
- POST /tenants/select        (#884 Phase 3 PR 1): records the user's chosen
  workspace via signed cookie so subsequent requests route to that tenant.
  User-auth only.
- POST /tenants/invite        (#884 Phase 3 PR 2): generates a signed invite
  token for a group the caller belongs to. User-auth only.
- POST /tenants/invite/accept (#884 Phase 3 PR 2): adds the caller to the
  group named in a valid invite token via Cognito Admin API. User-auth only.

Reset and admin endpoints live in later PRs of the #884 split.
