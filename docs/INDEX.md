# Documentation Index

*Curated entry-point for every doc in this repo. One line per file, terse and information-dense — readable as a reference table, not as prose.*

> **Looking for the structural guide?** See [`README.md`](README.md) for the layer model, decision tree, and naming conventions. This file (`INDEX.md`) lists what's there now.
>
> **Maintained by the [`docs-index`](../.claude/skills/docs-index/SKILL.md) Claude skill.** When a doc is added, removed, or significantly rewritten, update its line here. Skill is the conventional path; manual updates are also fine.
