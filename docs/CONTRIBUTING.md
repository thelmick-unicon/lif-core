# Contributing to `LIF-MAIN`

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome pull requests, ideas, and feedback to help improve this project.

This guide outlines how to get set up, our coding standards, and how to propose changes.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lif-main.git
   cd lif-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

---

## How to Contribute

- **Report bugs** or **suggest features** by opening an issue.
- **Fix bugs**, **add features**, or **improve documentation** via pull requests (PRs).
- Contributions should generally **start with an open issue or a well-defined task**.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

We aim to keep our codebase clean, reviewable, and maintainable. Please follow these guidelines:

- **Small and focused**: PRs should address **one issue or task**. Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes (e.g., don’t fix bugs and add new features in the same PR).
- **Descriptive**: Provide a clear summary of what the PR does and why, referencing the related issue number (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- **Review protocol**:
  - PR authors **should not approve their own pull requests**, except for:
    - Trivial changes (e.g., typo fixes)
    - Documentation-only updates
  - All other PRs require review and approval from another contributor.
- **Tests**: Include or update tests as appropriate.
- Make sure the code:
  - Passes linting and formatting checks (`ruff`)
  - Passes type checking (`ty`)
  - Passes all tests (`pytest`)

## 🧹 Code Style & Tooling

We enforce consistent code style using:

- [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) – code formatter / fast linter
- [`ty`] (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) - static type checker
- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) – automates checks

### Before You Commit

Make sure code passes formatting and linting:

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format
uv run ty check
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
ruff check
ruff format
ty check
```

Or run all checks at once with:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
Or if the virtual environment has been activated with `source .venv/bin/activate`:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## Running Tests

Tests are required for new features and bugfixes.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
uxv pytest
```

Or if the virtual environment has been activated with `source .venv/bin.activate`:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Conventional commit style is encouraged:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `refactor:` for internal changes that don't affect behavior
