# `docs/` Directory

This directory contains centralized technical documentation for the LIF system. Its purpose is to support contributors and operators by providing reference material that is not tied to specific modules, components, or deployment configurations elsewhere in the repository.

## Purpose

The `docs/` directory is intended to:
- Capture **technical guidance** on developing or deploying LIF components
- Document **contribution processes**, **governance**, and **project roles**
- Serve as a reference for engineers and DevOps personnel working with the monorepo structure

This is distinct from user-facing or high-level functional documentation, which resides here **{insert link when we have it}**.

## Typical Contents

- `index.md` – Entry point or overview for the technical documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Guidelines for submitting code, filing issues, and collaborating effectively
- `COMMITTERS.md` – List of project committers and governance roles

Additional Markdown files, diagrams, and supporting assets may be added over time as the system evolves.

## Audience

The documentation in this directory is written for:
- **Developers** contributing to the LIF architecture or components
- **DevOps and platform engineers** deploying or integrating LIF services
- **Internal stakeholders** who need insight into engineering standards, tooling, and project structure

## General LIF Documentation

For broader LIF system overviews, user guides, or high-level architecture, please refer to:

**[LIF System Overview and General Docs](https://)**  
***(Update link when available.)***

## Contribution

If you are adding or updating documentation:
- Keep files focused and scoped by topic
- Use clear section headings and consistent formatting
- Prefer Markdown (`.md`) for compatibility and readability
- Place related images or diagrams in a subfolder, if needed
