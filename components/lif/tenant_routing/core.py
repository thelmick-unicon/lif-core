"""Tenant-schema resolution for multi-tenant LIF services (issue #883).

Pure functions with no framework or service dependencies. Currently used by
the MDR auth middleware (to set ``request.state.tenant_schema``) and the
MDR tenant-provisioning service (to derive the schema name for a new
Cognito group). Extracted from ``lif.mdr_auth.tenant`` so other auth-gated
services — Advisor, LIF API — can reuse the same sanitize/resolve contract
without taking a dependency on MDR.

Tenant schemas are named ``tenant_{sanitized-group-name}`` and must fit PG's
63-char identifier limit. Group names come from Cognito and can contain
characters (hyphens, case mix) that PostgreSQL treats as identifier-hostile
without quoting; we sanitize rather than quote so the schema name is stable
across every code path that constructs it.
